0.2.0
-----
* Decided on the MIT License, exciting.
* Added a log message for what we'll be posting: "INFO      Found 1 file(s) totalling 1.0MiB".
* Added a status line while posting, updated once per second: "Posted 0.2MiB - Current speed: 30.3KiB/s".
* Added a total posted/speed value for each server once it finishes posting, not sure why it has so many decimal
  places: "INFO      [test] Posted 484.6MiB in 24.392107862s at 20342.0KB/s".
* Added global/SubjectPrefix config option: a string that is prefixed to every subject line (GH-5).
* Added global/ChunkSize config option: how much data (in bytes) to write to the socket at a time. The default of 10KB
  seems fine for saturating 250Mbit.
* Added server/InsecureSSL config option: connection will succeed even if there are SSL errors such as self-signed
  certificates (GH-7).
* Added a "-g group" command line option to override the config default newsgroups.
* Added the GoPostStuff version number to the X-Newsposter header of each article, this should help a lot with tracking
  down any post mangling issues.
* Fixed some inaccurate command line option help text.
* Fixed a crash when connecting to a server with SSL errors, GoPostStuff will now quit cleanly instead.
